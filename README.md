## Application Description
The goal of the project is to manage product sales and inventory information using the access database. The program will generally include products, categories and sales.The project also has additional features such as listening to the radio.

## Usage
Let's examine the admin panel that allows us to log in to the program. The image you see below is the program's admin login panel. The username is "user" and the password is "1234." If the username and password are entered correctly, the program will log into the system; otherwise, the program will give an error and will not log into the system.

### Change password
There is also a password change area in the application. You can change your password by clicking on the change password button. There is only one username in the system, which is "user". After entering the current password, if you enter and confirm the new password, the password will change. You can see all the situations in the images below.
